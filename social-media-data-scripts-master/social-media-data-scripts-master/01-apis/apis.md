# APIs

One of the ways in which companies allow you to tap into these data troves is via an API, which stands for Application Programming Interface. APIs are like a kind of middleman between the social media platform and developers who wish to access information from the platform.

An API can also allow us to make requests for specific data, which weâ€™ll receive in a structured form. Developers can request data with a script (code that is written to perform specific and often repetitive tasks for us) by opening up a data stream (basically a very plain website that displays one data point after another based on what a developer requested) through the API and then by compiling each data point into a spreadsheet.

This directory contains scripts related to APIs.

### Getting started

If you have followed the installation steps from the `README.md` you can skip step 2.

1. Open up your Terminal and go to the folder where you want to clone this repository of code using the `cd` bash command.
```
cd social-media-data-scripts
```

2. Then install all the dependencies, i.e. the Python libraries we are using for these scripts by running the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or
```
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If you have problems with installing the dependencies through
```
pip install requests
pip install tweepy --ignore-installed six
pip install beautifulsoup4
```
or
```
sudo pip install requests
sudo pip install tweepy --ignore-installed six
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

3. Make a secrets.py file that is modeled after the `secrets.py.example` file by going into the `scripts` directory and running these bash commands
```
cd scripts
cp secrets.py.example secrets.py
```
Now you have a `secrets.py` file! ðŸ¤— Open it up in a text editor of your choice (like Atom or Sublime Text!) and fill the credentials you created earlier. Don't forget to save it!

### Using Twitter's API

#### Scripts

* [twitter_tweet_dumper.py](https://github.com/lamthuyvo/social-media-data-scripts/blob/master/01-apis/scripts/twitter_tweet_dumper.py): Up to 3200 tweets from an individual account (includes tweet id, time stamp, location, text, retweet count, favorite count (though the favorite count is inaccurate for retweets), whether something was a manual retweet, how it was tweeted (Tweetdek, Android, etc.)). This script was modified from [@Yanofsky](https://gist.github.com/yanofsky/5436496)'s original script.
* [twitter_get_friends.py](https://github.com/lamthuyvo/social-media-data-scripts/blob/master/01-apis/scripts/twitter_get_friends.py): Twitter user bios (name, display name, bio, followers count (at time of scraping),  following count (at time of scraping), when the account was created, location given in the bio) for all the accounts that a specific user follows.
* [twitter_get_followers.py](https://github.com/lamthuyvo/social-media-data-scripts/blob/master/01-apis/scripts/twitter_get_followers.py): Twitter user bios (name, display name, bio, followers count (at time of scraping),  following count (at time of scraping), when the account was created, location given in the bio) for all the accounts that follow a specific user.
* [twitter_bio_info_compiler.py](https://github.com/lamthuyvo/social-media-data-scripts/blob/master/01-apis/scripts/twitter_bio_info_compiler.py): Twitter user bios (name, display name, bio, followers count (at time of scraping),  following count (at time of scraping), when the account was created, location given in the bio) for a list of accounts you specify
* [twitter_searcher.py](https://github.com/lamthuyvo/social-media-data-scripts/blob/master/01-apis/scripts/twitter_searcher.py): You can search Twitter via its search API going back 7 days and grab tweets (id, author name, timestamp when it was created, favorites (again, unreliable), retweets, text)

### Using Facebook's API
Note: changes to the Facebook API now requires API users to undergo additional screening processes before being able to gather information on public posts. 

#### Scripts
* [fb_get_posts_fb_group.py](https://github.com/lamthuyvo/social-media-data-scripts/blob/master/01-apis/scripts/fb_get_posts_fb_group.py) or [fb_get_posts_fb_group_multiple.py](https://github.com/lamthuyvo/social-media-data-scripts/blob/master/01-apis/scripts/fb_get_posts_fb_group_multiple.py): These scripts allow you to gather data from _public_ Facebook groups, either from just one or multiple groups. Adapted from [@minimaxir](https://github.com/minimaxir/facebook-page-post-scraper)'s scripts.
* [fb_get_posts_fb_page.py](https://github.com/lamthuyvo/social-media-data-scripts/blob/master/01-apis/scripts/fb_get_posts_fb_page.py) or [fb_get_posts_fb_page_multiple.py](https://github.com/lamthuyvo/social-media-data-scripts/blob/master/01-apis/scripts/fb_get_posts_fb_page_multiple.py): These scripts allow you to gather data from _public_ Facebook pages, either from just one or multiple pages. Adapted from [@minimaxir](https://github.com/minimaxir/facebook-page-post-scraper)'s scripts.
* [fb_get_comments_from_fb.py](https://github.com/lamthuyvo/social-media-data-scripts/blob/master/01-apis/scripts/fb_get_comments.py): This script allows you to get the comments from each Facebook group or page _after_ you have run the aforementioned scripts. Adapted from [@minimaxir](https://github.com/minimaxir/facebook-page-post-scraper)'s scripts.
* [fb_get_page_info.py](https://github.com/lamthuyvo/social-media-data-scripts/blob/master/01-apis/scripts/fb_get_comments.py): This script allows you to get Facebook Page information, such as the title, description, fan count, for a number of Facebook pages.  
* [fb_id_proofer.py](https://github.com/lamthuyvo/social-media-data-scripts/blob/master/01-apis/scripts/fb_id_proofer.py): This script allows you to go through a list of Facebook Page IDs and see whether they are valid.

### Using YouTube's API
* [youtube-get-video-info.py](https://github.com/lamthuyvo/social-media-data-scripts/blob/master/01-apis/scripts/youtube-get-video-info.py): This script allows you to go through a list of video IDs and collect information like their title, description, view count and other meta data.
* [youtube-get-channel-info.py](https://github.com/lamthuyvo/social-media-data-scripts/blob/master/01-apis/scripts/youtube-get-channel-info.py): This script allows you to go through a list of channel IDs and collect information like their title, description, view count and other meta data.

## How to run each script
1. Follow the instructions in the comments of each script to customize your API query and resulting `.csv` file
2. Run your script with the bash command `python3 scriptname.py` to generate a csv of tweets or Facebook posts. Then, go make do some journalism-ing!
